  # (default: 0.1) The minimum forward velocity allowed for the base in meters/sec.
  # It is useful to specify this to guarantee that velocity commands sent to a mobile base
  # are high enough to allow the base to overcome friction.
  min_vel_x:  0.1
  # (default: -0.1) Speed used for driving during escapes in meters/sec.
  # Note that it must be negative in order for the robot to actually reverse.
  # A positive speed will cause the robot to move forward while attempting to escape
  escape_vel: -0.1
  # (default: true) Determines whether velocity commands are generated for a holonomic
  # or non-holonomic robot. For holonomic robots, strafing velocity commands may be issued
  # to the base. For non-holonomic robots, no strafing velocity commands will be issued.
  holonomic_robot: false

  # (default: 0.10) The tolerance in meters for the controller in the x & y distance
  # when achieving a goal

  # when achieving its goal

  # in-place-rotation trajectories
  heading_lookahead: 0.225
  # (default: true) Whether to use the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) or whether
  # to use Trajectory Rollout (NOTE: In our experience DWA worked as well as
  # Trajectory Rollout and is computationally less expensive. It is possible that
  # robots with extremely poor acceleration limits could gain from running
  # Trajectory Rollout, but we recommend trying DWA first.)

  # (default: 0.05) How far the robot must travel in meters before oscillation
  # flags are reset

  # (default: false) Whether the gdist_scale and pdist_scale/goal/path_distance_bias
  # parameters should assume that goal_distance and path_distance are expressed in
  # units of meters or cells. Cells are assumed by default.
